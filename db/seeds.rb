# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# 5.times do |n|
#   username  = "example-#{n+1}"
#   email = "example-#{n+1}@example.com"
#   password = "password"
#   User.create!(username:  username,
#                email: email,
#                password:              password,
#                password_confirmation: password)
